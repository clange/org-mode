org-mode
========

Diverse stuff related to Emacs org-mode.

* [clocktable-spreadsheet](clocktable-spreadsheet): an approach for generating reports from clock logs by combining clocktables with spreadsheet formulas.  Here are further tools useful in this context:
  * For tracking time outside of Org mode, e.g., on mobile, see [csv2orgclock](https://github.com/clange/csv2orgclock).  Before that, I used plain-text notes and converted them using [org-offline-to-clock](https://github.com/clange/scripts/tree/master/org-offline-to-clock).
  * For automatically recomputing clocktables and spreadsheets, I wrote [org-recompute-clocktables](https://github.com/clange/scripts/tree/master/org-recompute-clocktables).
  * In addition, I have templates and makefiles to generate monthly timesheets (available on request)
